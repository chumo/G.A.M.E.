G.A.M.E.
========
(**Giant Atom Manipulator for Education**)

This is the program to control a G.A.M.E., a demonstrator tool for showing the working principle of a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM). The scanner of a 3D printer (RepRap Berlin i3) is used as the scanner of the device. A crystalline surface made out of atoms (wooden beads) is imaged with a distance sensor attached to the STM tip. An electromagnet is also installed on the tip to manipulate a metallic ball representing an adatom (atom adsorbed on top of the crystalline surface).

I built this demonstrator for the *Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften* 2014 at [Paul-Drude-Institut der Festkörperelektronik](http://www.pdi-berlin.de/home/) (Berlin), an *open-house* event in which the general public visits scientific facilities.

The project was presented at the [Science Hack Day Berlin](http://berlin.sciencehackday.org/) during the 2013 edition. A team formed by Hendrik Mohrmann, Juan García Basilio, Christoph Limbach and myself developed there the first prototype.

The result can be seen at the following youtube links:
